# FibrilSite

**FibrilSite** is a computational pipeline to define fibril sites and identify shared features across a database of defined sites. 

Fibril surface sites are extracted from fibril surface as point clouds featurized with surface properties including Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum electrostatics, hydrophobicity, shape index and hydrogen bond donors/acceptor patterns.
