# FibrilSite

**FibrilSite** is a computational pipeline to define fibril sites and identify shared features across a database of defined sites. 

Fibril surface sites are extracted from fibril surface as point clouds featurized with surface properties including Poisson–Boltzmann continuum electrostatics, hydrophobicity, shape index and hydrogen bond donors/acceptor patterns. 

## Fibril structure preparation

Fibril structures were pre-processed and surface features were computed using the **MaSIF** (Molecular Surface Interaction Fingerprinting) framework, as described in
